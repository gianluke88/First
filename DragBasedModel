%% Function to evaluate time of arrival via the DBM 
% This function evaluates the time of arrival of ICME at d AUs according 
% to the Drag-Based Model equations with constant solar wind and 
% drag parameter. Input variables are background solar wind speed
% w (in km/s), initial height R0 (in solar radii), target distance 
% d (in AUs) and drag parameter gamma (in 10^-7 km^-1).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

function t = arrivaltime(R0,v0,w,d,gamma) 
%% Input parameters, constants and unit conversions
%constants
AU = 149597871;         % 1 AU in Km
% Input parameters
gamma=gamma*10^(-7);    %drag coefficient, gamma units are Km^-1
dv=v0-w;                % initial relative speed
s=sign(dv);
%conversions
r0=R0*696000;           % initial distance R0 converted in Km
                        % 1 Solar radius = 696000 Km                                           
%% Time of arrival at 1AU computation
% Estimation of time of arrival (to give a starting point to fzero)
if w>100
    extT = (AU-(r0/AU))/(w);  %extimated time of arrival in seconds
else
    extT = 2*(AU-(r0/AU))/(v0); 
end
% (Another evaluation of extT may be based on the characteristic 
% deceleration length gamma^-1)
%% Finding root of equation 
fun = @(T) s*(1/gamma)*log(1+s*gamma*dv*T)+w*T+r0-d*AU;
t = fzero(fun,extT)/3600;
if  isnan(fzero(fun,extT))
    for i=2:100
        t = fzero(fun,i*extT); %change point to search root of equation
        if isnan(t)
            continue 
        else
        break
        end
    end
end
